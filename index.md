<!--
  This is the same as mcp-2.0 except for the name.
  Need to templatize and drive with data
-->

[A schema.xsd file you can use to bundle the mcp extensions with ISO19139 and ISO19119](/public/download/mcp-2.0/mcpExtensions.xsd)

[The MCP extensions](/public/download/mcp-2.0/mcpExtensions.xsd)

[The MCP code lists (extended ISO19139 codelists)](/public/download/mcp-2.0/mcpDwcTerms.xsd)  


Zipped MCP xsds [here](/public/download/mcp-2.0/zipped.zip). 

<!-- Could factor usage into a _layout template -->
To use:

  - Download the Zipped MCP xsds from the link above and unzip it into a new directory - you should then have a schema subdirectory and a file called schema.xsd
  - Use the schema.xsd file in your application.


Note the MCP includes ISO19115/19139 schemas from <http://www.isotc211.org/2005>
