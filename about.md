### ISO 19115 Metadata

#### ISO 19115:2003 Marine Community Profile (MCP) V2.0 Metadata

The Australian marine community has developed a profile (i.e. a customised implementation) of the ISO 19115 metadata standard called the Marine Community Profile (MCP). Metadata is information about data that helps a potential data user understand whether a dataset is fit for a particular purpose. Registered and indexed metadata also provides useful information items by which a user can search for, and discover datasets. Metadata is usually rendered in XML.

MCP V2.0 is used for documenting datasets that are shared via the IMOS/AODN Ocean Portal. It is applied, in the portal context, using some mandatory controlled vocabularies to populate specific metadata elements. IMOS has adopted MCP V2.0, despite it still being in a ‘draft’ state, because it provides the metadata elements necessary for homogenized, flexible data search and discovery. The current community-approved profile is MCP V1.4. This profile cannot, however, adequately support faceted searching, as used in the IMOS/AODN Ocean Portal. The community group managing development and application of the MCP is called the MCP Governance Committee.

#### ISO 19115-1 Metadata Update

In late 2013, the MCP Governance Committee positively considered a move from MCP V1.4, to its successor MCP V2.0, but final community ratification of V2.0 was postponed until the Committee could consider any ensuing implications of an in parallel update to the ISO 19115:2003 base standard. This update to a new base (ISO 19115-1) occurred in April 2014.

The community, via the MCP Governance Committee, is embarking on a process that will determine the shape and content of a new community profile, based on ISO 19115-1. Once this task has been completed the design of the portal 1-2-3 will be upgraded to reflect any nuances involved in the use of this new profile. In the meantime, MCP V2.0 is the profile to be followed when using the IMOS/AODN Ocean Portal. The MCP wiki is the forum for discussion papers on suggested changes and the repository for historical information on the profile.
