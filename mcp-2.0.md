<!-- 
  - can use yaml to encode the entries in public 
  - or even just extract with pattern matching on static content
  - Could symbolically link into the public dir? - linking exposes the entire subdirectory...

  - perhaps browse geonetwork plugins...
  - note that it's regenerating constantly...
-->

<!-- think we want hard-coded links in order to control ordering -->

[A schema.xsd file you can use to bundle the mcp extensions with ISO19139 and ISO19119](/public/download/mcpExtensions.xsd)

[The MCP extensions](/public/download/mcpExtensions.xsd)

[The MCP code lists (extended ISO19139 codelists)](/public/download/mcpDwcTerms.xsd)  


Zipped MCP xsds [here](/public/download/zipped.zip). 

To use:

  - Download the Zipped MCP xsds from the link above and unzip it into a new directory - you should then have a schema subdirectory and a file called schema.xsd
  - Use the schema.xsd file in your application.


Note the MCP includes ISO19115/19139 schemas from <http://www.isotc211.org/2005>
